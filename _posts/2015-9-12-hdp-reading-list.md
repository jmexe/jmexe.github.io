HDP can be regarded as an extension of the LDA. Before studying HDP, it is recommended to understand the model of LDA.

This is a tutorial of Gibbs Sampling which is very intuitive.

A simplest tutorial of measure theory, can be used for getting familiar with the terms in measure theory.

An introduction to DP which gives some intuitive examples.

> [Teh, Yee Whye, et al. "Hierarchical dirichlet processes."]

Original paper of HDP. There is another short version, both are worth reading. 

> [Heinrich, Gregor. "Infinite LDA implementing the HDP with minimum code complexity."] 

This is a really good paper for understanding HDP. The author firstly introducing the DP by extending the DD and then provided a simplified model which is similar to LDA. An Java implementation of HDP is attached in this paper.
