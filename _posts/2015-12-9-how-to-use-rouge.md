####Introduction
[ROUGE] is a software package for automated evaluation of summaries. You can download the package from the webpage.
Due to the lack of documents, you may need to read this post to figure out the ROUGE installation: [Figure out ROUGE].

Also [Kavita Ganesan] have provided a java version of the ROUGE. For those who are not familiar with perl, this could be a good alternative.
####Organize your project
Your project should contain three parts:

1. /peers: This folder contains all the summaries need to be evaluated. Each file can be identified by the id of the system and the set of documents for which the summary was generated. Here is an example: D30026.M.100.T.101, which means the summary is generated by system 101 from the group of texts whose id is D30026.

2. /models: This folder cantains all the reference summaries that are used for evaluation. Each file can be identified in the same way as the files in /peers folder

3. rouge.xml: This is the input file for rouge script, it sepcifies which models should be used in evaluating each peer. A good explanation of the detailed format is given by [Kavita Ganesan]. If you happen to work with the DUC dataset, a script that's called "makeRougeScript.pl" could be used for creating this file, it is included in the package. You can define the root path of the peer and model files int the script. And simply run the script as following:

> perl makeRougeScript.pl 2 > your_input_name.xml

Number 2 is the task number.

####Run the evaluation tasks
To run the evaluation tasks, you just need to run:

> perl ROUGE-1.5.5.pl -a -c 95 -b 665 -m -n 4 -w 1.2 input.xml > output.xml

####Analyze the result
Rouge will generate an output that's not to easy to read, thanks to [Kavita Ganesan], implemented a easy-to-use tool [rouge2csv] to parse the output into a CSV format which will be much easier to read. 

###Handle the exceptions
#####Cannot open smart_
Export the path:

>ROUGE_EVAL_HOME=/usr/local/rouge/data
>export ROUGE_EVAL_HOME
